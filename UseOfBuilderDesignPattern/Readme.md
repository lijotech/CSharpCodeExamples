## Builder Design Pattern

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that helps in constructing complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## When to Use the Builder Design Pattern

- Complex Object Creation: When the creation process involves multiple steps or configurations.
- Immutability: When you want to create immutable objects with many optional parameters.
- Readability: When you want to improve the readability of the code by avoiding complex constructors.

## Drawbacks
- Increased Complexity: Adds more classes to the codebase.
- Overhead: May introduce unnecessary overhead if the object construction is simple.


## Extending the Builder Pattern with Fluent Interface 
To make the Builder Pattern more intuitive, you can use a fluent interface.

The Builder Design Pattern is a powerful tool for constructing complex objects in a clean and readable manner. By extending it with fluent interfaces, you can make the code even more intuitive and maintainable.
