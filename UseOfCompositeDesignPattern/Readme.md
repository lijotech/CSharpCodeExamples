## Composite Design Pattern in C#

The Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Let's dive into the details of this pattern, its components, and a real-world example to understand its implementation and usage.

## Components of the Composite Design Pattern
- Component: This is an abstract class or interface that defines the common operations for both simple and complex objects of the tree structure.

- Leaf: This represents the individual objects in the composition. A leaf doesn't have any children.

- Composite: This represents the complex objects that may have children. A composite can contain both leaf and other composite objects.


## Real-World Example: Company Organizational Structure

Imagine you are developing an application to manage a company's organizational structure. You need to represent employees and managers in a way that allows you to treat them uniformly, whether they are individual contributors or managers with subordinates.

### Component

The Employee class is the abstract component that defines the common operations for both individual contributors and managers.

```
public abstract class Employee
{
    protected string name;
    protected string position;

    public Employee(string name, string position)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.position = position;
    }

    public abstract void DisplayDetails();
    public abstract int GetTotalSubordinates();
}
```

### Leaf

The IndividualContributor class represents the individual employees who do not have any subordinates.

```
public class IndividualContributor : Employee
{
    public IndividualContributor(string name, string position) : base(name, position) { }

    public override void DisplayDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{position}: {name}");
    }

    public override int GetTotalSubordinates()
    {
        return 0; // Individual contributors have no subordinates
    }
}
```

## Composite

The Manager class represents the managers who can have subordinates. This class implements the IEmployeeOperations interface to manage the subordinates

```
public interface IEmployeeOperations
{
    void Add(Employee employee);
    void Remove(Employee employee);
}

public class Manager : Employee, IEmployeeOperations
{
    private List<Employee> _subordinates = new List<Employee>();

    public Manager(string name, string position) : base(name, position) { }

    public void Add(Employee employee)
    {
        _subordinates.Add(employee);
    }

    public void Remove(Employee employee)
    {
        _subordinates.Remove(employee);
    }

    public override void DisplayDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{position}: {name} (Total subordinates: {GetTotalSubordinates()})");
        foreach (var subordinate in _subordinates)
        {
            subordinate.DisplayDetails();
        }
    }

    public override int GetTotalSubordinates()
    {
        int totalSubordinates = _subordinates.Count;
        foreach (var subordinate in _subordinates)
        {
            totalSubordinates += subordinate.GetTotalSubordinates();
        }
        return totalSubordinates;
    }
}
```

### Client

The client code demonstrates how to use the composite pattern to manage the organizational structure.

```
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var developer = new IndividualContributor("Alice", "Developer");
        var designer = new IndividualContributor("Bob", "Designer");

        var manager = new Manager("Charlie", "Manager");
        manager.Add(developer);
        manager.Add(designer);

        var ceo = new Manager("Diana", "CEO");
        ceo.Add(manager);

        ceo.DisplayDetails();
    }
}
```

## Usage Scenarios

- Company Organizational Structures: Representing employees and managers.

- File System Hierarchies: Files and directories can be treated uniformly.

- UI Components: Widgets that contain other widgets.

- Graphics Drawing Applications: Shapes that can contain other shapes.


## Advantages

- Simplifies Client Code: Clients can treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

- Easier to Add New Components: You can add new types of components without changing existing code.

- Flexible Tree Structures: Allows for complex tree structures to be created and managed easily.

## Disadvantages

- Complexity: The pattern can introduce complexity in the code, especially when dealing with a large number of objects.

- Overhead: Managing the tree structure can add overhead, particularly if the tree is deep or has many nodes.

The Composite Design Pattern is particularly useful when you need to work with tree structures and want to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It provides a flexible and scalable solution for managing complex hierarchies in your applications.
